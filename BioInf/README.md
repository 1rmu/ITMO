# Bioinformatics course.

As part of this course, I have solved a number of tasks on the [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/) website. This repository provides solutions to:

* [Task 1](./Task1) - Find a Median String.
* [Task 2](./Task2) - Implement RandomizedMotifSearch.
* [Task 3](./Task3) - Reconstruct a String from its Paired Composition.
* [Task 4](./Task4) - Align Two Strings Using Affine Gap Penalties.
* [Task 5](./Task5) - Find a Shortest Transformation of One Genome into Another by 2-Breaks.
* [Task 6](./Task6) - Implement AdditivePhylogeny.
* [Task 7](./Task7) - Implement the Viterbi Algorithm.
* [Task 8](./Task8) - Find the Longest Repeat in a String.

# Bioinformatics course.

As part of this course, I have solved a number of tasks on the [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/) website. This repository provides solutions to:

* Task 1 - Find a Median String.
* Task 2 - Implement RandomizedMotifSearch.
* Task 3 - Reconstruct a String from its Paired Composition.
* Task 4 - Align Two Strings Using Affine Gap Penalties.
* Task 5 - Find a Shortest Transformation of One Genome into Another by 2-Breaks.
* Task 6 - Implement AdditivePhylogeny.
* Task 7 - Implement the Viterbi Algorithm.
* Task 8 - Find the Longest Repeat in a String.
